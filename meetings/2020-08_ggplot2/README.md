### Details
Data visualization is important in most phases of data analysis workflow and being able to create visualizations of data is a key step in being able to effectively communicate information and findings to others. In this Bio-data Club series I will talk about how to use `ggplot2` R package to visualize your data. `ggplot2` is a plotting framework that is (relatively) easy to use, powerful and hassle-free. It is based on a set of principles "Grammar of graphic" and is designed to work in a layered fashion, starting with a layer showing the data then adding layers of graphical objects, annotations and statistical summaries.
 

### Pre-requisites
Please make sure you have `tidyverse`, `patchwork`, `ggridges`, and `palmerpenguins` R packages installed before the talk. I will be using penguins data from `palmerpenguins` package for the talk (more information about the data at [https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins)).
