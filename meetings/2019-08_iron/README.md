# August 2019: Iterative Rank Order Normalization (IRON)

## Presenter: [Eric Welsh](mailto:eric.welsh@moffitt.org)

### Meeting location
Date/time: Friday, August 17th @ 2pm

Location: [Moffitt Stabile Research Building (SRB)](https://goo.gl/maps/o6j3rtTuxCB2), Couch Auditorium
### Meeting details

'We developed an approach, termed IRON, which uses the best-performing techniques from each of several popular processing methods while retaining the ability to incrementally renormalize data without altering previously normalized expression. This combination of approaches results in a method that performs comparably to existing approaches on artificial benchmark datasets (i.e. spike-in) and demonstrates promising improvements in segregating true signals within biologically complex experiments.'
