## January 2019 - R/Shiny

### Discussion lead: [Ram Thapa](mailto:ram.thapa@moffitt.org)

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps directly from R. We create user interface and server using R and Shiny app complies the codes to display the application on the web. The Shiny app executes R code on the backend and the outputs displayed in the user interface depend on the user inputs.  

In this talk we will go over the basic features and workings of a Shiny application. 

Few things you will need:
* Relatively recent version of [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* R libraries/packages needed:
    * Shiny
    * tidyverse
    * gapminder
    * To install, open R and paste `install.packages(c("shiny", "tidyverse", "gapminder"))`
