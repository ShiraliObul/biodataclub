### Details
Description: In this tutorial, I will give a brief introduction on the functionalities of the ComplexHeatmap package, including how to customize a single heatmap, how to select a proper heatmap annotation graphic, how to combine multiple heatmaps to construct a complex visualization. I will also demonstrate high-level visualizations implemented with ComplexHeatmap, including the oncoPrint, the UpSet plot, the enriched heatmap and the density heatmap. In the end, I will show you how to convert a static heatmap easily to an interactive Shiny application.
