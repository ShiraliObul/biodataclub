# March 2019: Automate your pathway enrichment analysis with R
## Presenter: [Paul Stewart](mailto:paul.stewart@moffitt.org)
### Meeting location
Date/time: Friday, March 15th @ 2pm

Location: [Moffitt Stabile Research Building (SRB)](https://goo.gl/maps/o6j3rtTuxCB2), David Murphey Conference Room (1st floor)

### Meeting details
Pathway enrichment analysis is a [common computational method](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002375) for deriving biological meaning from large lists of genes. We will begin with a gentle introduction to the mathematical concepts used in pathway enrichment analysis. Next, we will discuss some practical considerations and the interpretation of results. Finally, we will use the R programming language to build a simple, reproducible pathway enrichment pipeline that can be used in your research.

### Meeting prerequisites
* A laptop with an internet connection.
* Current versions of [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
    * You will need to install the [enrichR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/enrichR/vignettes/enrichR.html) R package. To do this, first install R and RStudio. Next, open RStudio and find the "Console" window. In this window, type the command: `install.packages('enrichR')`.
* Familiarity with R is a plus but not required.
