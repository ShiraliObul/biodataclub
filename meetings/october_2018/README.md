## Meeting
The inaugural meeting of the Bio-Data Club will cover version control with git. The meeting will be hands-on, so make sure to bring a laptop with an internet connection and Sourcetree installed. We will begin with a brief introduction to the concepts of git and then move on to some hands-on learning (no prior experience needed). At the end of the meeting, you will know how to create a repository, commit changes, and push/pull changes from a remote repository.
