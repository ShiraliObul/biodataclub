# October 2018 Meeting: Introduction to version control with git

## Prerequisites
* A laptop with an internet connection
* Install Sourcetree **beta** (supports GitLab) - [Mac Version](https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/sourcetree-betas/downloads/OSX_Beta_Latest.zip) - [Windows Version](https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/sourcetree-betas/downloads/SourceTreeSetup-3.0.5-beta-2178.exe)
* An [Atlassian account](https://id.atlassian.com/signup) (you will be prompted to create one when installing Sourcetree; you already have one if you have logged in to Stride)
* No prior experience with git is needed

## Meeting
The inaugural meeting of the Bio-Data Club will focus on version control with git. The meeting will be hands-on, so make sure to bring a laptop with Sourcetree beta already installed. The direct link to the Sourcetree beta versions linked above support GitLab, which is the internal Moffitt git server. 

The first portion of the meeting will focus on an introduction to basic concepts of git. We will then move to the hands-on portion. No prior experience with git is needed. Time permitting, we will configure Sourcetree to connect to GitLab and push changes to the remote repository.
