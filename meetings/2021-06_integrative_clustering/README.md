### Details

Integrative clustering is a powerful approach to identify latent subtype structure inherent in multi-source ‘omics data set accounting for both between and within data correlations. I will briefly go over non-parametric approach of integrative clustering method, intNMF, based on non-negative matrix factorization. Next, I will briefly go over simulation of multiple types of ‘omic data using R package interSIM. Finally, I will demonstrate a couple of examples of application of intNMF using  (i) simulated data, and (ii) one real data from TCGA studies on glioblastoma.
 
### Pre-Requisites

Pre-requisites: 
* A laptop with current version of R installed.
* R packages interSIM and intNMF installed. 
* Familiarity with R or any other programming experience would be a plus but not required.
