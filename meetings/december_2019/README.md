# December 2019: The First Annual Bio-Data Club Hackathon

## Hackathon Details

The Moffitt Bio-Data club will be hosting it's first Hackathon on December 5th and 6th, 2019! A hackathon is an event in which participants come together to collaborate intensively on software projects. [Here is a short article](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/what-is-a-hackathon/) describing what you can expect. Please check out our [projects list](https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/blob/master/meetings/december_2019/Project_descriptions.md), or if you prefer to work independently, then you can come with your own idea and work on it in the shared hackathon space.

Participation is completely optional. Team members are under no obligation to participate. However, this will be a fun event and we encourage everyone to sign up! The event will be very low stakes, and we encourage **friendly** competition between teams. Although the team with the best project will receive a prize, every participant is a winner! 

## Registration
Registration is required. We need an accurate headcount so we can balance teams and send hackathon-related communications. Please register [with this form](https://forms.gle/84WHZRkcjfPeh4eg7) by Wednesday, November 27th 2019 or you might not be able to participate. 

## Rules
- Participants will be placed into teams based on the projects chosen during registration. These teams will be lead by a team leader who submitted their project idea to the hackathon organizing committee. Teams will have approximately 24 hours to develop a deliverable product (e.g. package, new method). 
- The maximum number of participants per team may need to be capped based on popularity. Preference will be given to early registrants.
- Each team will have 5 minutes to present their final product on Friday. Product demonstrations or slides will be acceptable.
- A panel of judges (the BBSR Advisory Committee) will pick the winning project. The winning project will be judged by the following categories:
  - Reproducibility
  - Impact on Moffitt
  - Usability
  - Scientific value
- The winning team will be awarded a prize and bragging rights for the year.
