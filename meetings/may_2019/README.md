### Meeting location
Date/time: Friday, May 24th @ 2pm

Location: [Moffitt Stabile Research Building (SRB)](https://goo.gl/maps/o6j3rtTuxCB2), David Murphey Conference Room (1st floor)

### Meeting details
This month's meeting will give an introduction to using containers with [docker](https://www.docker.com/). 'Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of applications into containers, so that you can install inside such a container the software you want, along with all what it needs to run: files system, code, system tools, obscure Perl libraries, etc.' You can read a blog post about its usefulness in bioinformatics [here](https://www.molecularecologist.com/2016/05/docker-making-our-bioinformatics-easier-and-more-reproducible/).

### Meeting prerequisites
* A laptop with an internet connection.
* The latest version of docker - (Mac)[https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-mac/install/] - (Windows)[https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-windows/install/]
