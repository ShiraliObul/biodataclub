### Details
We will go over an introduction to what [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is, followed by a hands-on tutorial.  We will go over some of the basic, more commonly used commands and then go through two different demos that show how to run Docker in an "on-demand" sort of way and another demo  on running a persistent docker container hosting a very simple web application.

### Pre-Requisites

For anyone that wants to join along please install Docker and they can pull down the git repo for the demos I will be running: https://gitlab.moffitt.usf.edu:8000/cukrassd/docker_demo .
