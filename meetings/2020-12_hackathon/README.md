# December 2020: The Second Annual Bio-Data Club Hackathon

## Hackathon Details

Registration for the Bio-Data Club's Second Annual Hackathon is now open! You can register at this link: https://forms.gle/4UQSkdTWGhwTV1cz7. The hackathon will commence December 10th 2020 at 9am and conclude with project presentations on December 11th at 3pm. A hackathon is an event in which participants come together to build a software product during a short period of time. [Here is a short article](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/what-is-a-hackathon/) describing what you can expect. [Last yearâ€™s hackathon](https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/tree/master/meetings/2019-12_hackathon) featured nearly 40 participants working collaboratively on 6 projects. Like last year, projects featured in this year's hackathon all have potential benefits for Moffitt. 

Participation is completely optional, and Moffitt employees are under no obligation to participate. However, this will be a fun event and we encourage everyone to sign up! The event will be very low stakes, and we encourage friendly competition between teams. The winning team will be awarded a small prize and bragging rights for the year. Since work on hackathon projects will occur during an intensive ~24 hour period, please make sure to obtain permission to participate from your supervisor or PI. 

## Registration
Registration is required and will allow us to send hackathon-related communications and calendar/zoom invites. Please register [with this form](https://forms.gle/4UQSkdTWGhwTV1cz7) by Thursday, December 3rd 2020 (one week prior to the start of the hackathon) or you may not be able to participate. 

## Rules
- Participants choose the team they wish to join during registration. 
- Teams will be overseen by a team leader who will delegate tasks.
- Teams will have approximately 24 hours to develop a deliverable product. 
- Each team will have 5 minutes to present their final product on Friday. Product demonstrations or slides will be acceptable.
- A panel of judges (Drs. Peter Kanetsky, John Koomen, Dana Rollison, John Schatzle, AC Tan) will pick the winning project. 
- The winning project will be judged by the following categories:
  - Reproducibility
  - Impact on Moffitt
  - Usability
  - Scientific value
- The winning team will be awarded a prize and bragging rights for the year.
- No work (e.g. writing code, analyzing data) should be performed prior to the start of the hackathon
  - The addition of completely new features to existing code will be acceptable. 

## Misc.
- Participants will be matched with their team leader approximately one week before the start of the hackathon. Team leaders are highly encouraged to on-board team members at this point. This will give teams time to complete setup tasks (e.g. read background material, download data, install packages, etc.) so they can hit the ground running on the day of the hackathon. 
- Some programming background in any language is recommended but not required. 
  - If you are not confident in your programming skills, then there may be non-programming tasks such as finding validation datasets, cleaning data, creating figures, or creating slides for the results presentation that will still allow you to participate.
