### Details

Researchers often create psychological measures based on common sense ideas of measurement. This practice at its worst rise to unfortunate examples, such as the ‘What Disney Princess Are You’ type scales on social media. In this talk, I will cover two essential concepts (reliability and validity) and show how to establish whether or not it makes sense to combine a set of psychological questions, such as those that measure attitudes or personality traits, into a single average of the items. I will cover the basics of latent variable modeling for confirmatory factor analysis and show examples in the R package [lavaan](https://lavaan.ugent.be/). In addition, I will briefly discuss how to establish internal consistency reliability (alpha). Optional exercises are provided for those who would like to explore more, and code is provided in which you can generate your own datasets and see how well your confirmatory factor analysis recovers the parameters you used in data generation.
