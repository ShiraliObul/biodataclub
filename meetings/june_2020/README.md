### Details

This talk will outline the basics of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), which is a new tool to automate tasks for you (aka CI/CD for the tech crowd). To demonstrate a simple use-case, I’ll show how you can have GitHub automatically render .pdf, .docx, .html, and .md versions of the same document whenever you edit the content in a source .Rmd.
 
### Pre-requisites
Prerequisites include a GitHub account and RStudio; if you want to reproduce my example in its entirety, you’ll also need the packages `glue`, `usethis`, and `fs` for a few minor tasks.
