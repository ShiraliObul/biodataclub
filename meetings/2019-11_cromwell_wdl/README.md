# November 2019: Cromwell and WDL Pipelines

## Presenter: [Scott Cukras](mailto:scott.cukras@moffitt.org)

### Location
Date/time: Friday, November 15th @ 2pm

Location: [Moffitt Stabile Research Building (SRB)](https://goo.gl/maps/o6j3rtTuxCB2), David Murphey Conference Room

### Details
This month's meeting will feature [Cromwell and WDL](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/). 

'In a nutshell, WDL was designed to make it easy to write scripts that describe analysis tasks and chain those tasks into workflows, with built-in support for advanced features like scatter-gather parallelism. This came at the cost of some additional headaches for the engineering team when they built Cromwell, the execution engine that runs WDL scripts -- but that was a conscious design decision, to push off the complexity onto the engineers rather than leave it in the lap of pipeline authors.' More about Cromwell and WDL at [this post by the developers](https://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/7349/the-art-of-the-pipeline-introducing-cromwell-wdl).
