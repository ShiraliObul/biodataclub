### Details
Research reproducibility is the basic building block of robust and impactful science. It allows other researchers to replicate the scientific workflow and verify results independently. Moreover a good research reproducibility workflow allows others to adopt and build upon existing knowledge with confidence. In this talk we will discuss tools to ensure reproducibility of computational analysis. We will specifically focus on CodeOcean by providing toy examples.
