### Details
DrugCell is an interpretable neural network-based model that predicts cell response to a wide range of drugs. This work was published in recently in Cancer Cell: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33096023/ . The current version of the model is trained using 509,294 (cell line, drug) pairs across 1,235 tumor cell lines and 684 drugs. 

The talk will cover the design of the model and what was learned building visible neural networks. Particpiants will then go through the inputs of the model, run a prediction through the command line, and show the outputs.

The talk will then transition to the web application (DrugCell Oracle) and discus the two tools that are included there: http://drugcell.ucsd.edu/landing/ .

### Pre-Requisites
* Clone the DrugCell GitHub repository https://github.com/idekerlab/DrugCell and set up the DrugCell Conda environment. Very detailed instructions for setup on Mac and Linux are included.
* Participants will need to download the pre-trained model to do the predictions themselves:
