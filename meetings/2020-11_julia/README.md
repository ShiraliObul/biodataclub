### Details
Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language developed specifically for scientific computing. This language is particularly useful for applications in data science, bioinformatics and many more. The library ecosystem is very much focused on scientific computation and research but can be used as a general-purpose programming language. Julia has a smaller community and less extensive ecosystem than both R and Python but is growing in popularity and is rapidly improved by an active community. Julia has become my preferred language for data analysis and is used for everyday tasks as a bioinformatician and developer.

In this Bio-data club presentation I will introduce the Julia language with a practical focus on getting started writing and debugging your own applications using the VS Code IDE.

### Pre-requisites
Have [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [VS Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) installed before talk.
