### Details

Intro to API’s

You’ve probably heard the terms API, Public API, or Web API before. An API (or Application Programming Interface) is a set of programming code that enables data transmission. 

In this session we will learn about the basic concepts of modern API’s and also how to interact with them.

No previous knowledge is required. Very basic Python will be used.
