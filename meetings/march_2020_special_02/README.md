# March 2020: Jupyter Notebooks

## Presenters: [Phillip Szepietowski](mailto:Phillip.Szepietowski@moffitt.org) and [Guillermo Gonzalez-Calderon](mailto:Guillermo.Gonzalez-Calderon@moffitt.org)

### Location
Date/time: Wednesday, March 25th @ 3pm

Location: **VIRTUAL MEETING** 

### Details

This seems like a good opportunity to present topics that may help with remote work and may answer common questions about tools and configurations, so the Bio-Data Club and MCC Cluster Users group will continue with joint special sessions. We realize there is a good degree of member overlap in the two groups, but want to make sure these sessions reach a broad audience interested in bio computing.
 
* Had you have issues installing Python packages with “pip”?   
* Do you have to use different library versions in Python?  
* Do you have a legacy application that uses and old Python version?   
* Do you want to run several versions of Python with different library versions?   
 
If you want to learn how to overcome those issues, please join us tomorrow Wednesday, March 25, 2020 from 3-4PM for a zoom-only presentation by Guillermo Gonzalez-Calderon and Phil Szepietowski on "Conda on the cluster". Conda is an open source package management solution originally developed for Python, but is useful for other languages as well, including R and C/C++. More info about Conda: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) .
 
Special thanks to Rodrigo Carvajal, Scott Cukras, Steven Eschrich, Guillermo Gonzalez-Calderon, Fredrik Pettersson, Phillip Szepietowski, and Jamie Teer for helping to organize and make this happen.
